#body mass index is calculated by kg/m^2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m^2 is their heigh in meteres squared
#for meters squared take centimeters convert to meters then multiply by itself
#a BMI of 25.0 is more overweight while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9 BMI
#the goal of this script is 3 things: convert kg to pounds, convert centimeters to meters to meters squared to inches, calculate bmi
#to calculate pounds and inches into bmi it is lbs * 703/ height**2

#part 1
def convert_kg_to_lbs(kg):
  conversion = kg * 2.20
  return conversion
result_of_weight = convert_kg_to_lbs(#insert_a_number_here)

#part 2
def convert_cm_to_in(cm)
  conversion_2 = cm * 0.39
  return conversion_2
result_of_height = convert_cm_to_in(#insert_a_number_here)

#part 3
# American system BMI is = lbs*703/height**2
BMI = result_of_weight*703/result_of_height**2 
  if  BMI > 25.0:
  print ("Overweight")
  elif 18.5 < BMI < 24.9:
  print ("Healthy")
  else:
  print ("Underweight")
