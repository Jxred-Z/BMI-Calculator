#body mass index is calculated by kg/m^2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m^2 is their heigh in meteres squared
#for meters squared take centimeters convert to meters then multiply by itself
#a BMI of 25.0 is more overweight while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9 BMI
# American system BMI is = lbs*703/height**2

#this function converts kg to lbs
